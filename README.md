# 202020

**What is the 20/20/20 rule?**
The 20/20/20 rule is an easy-to-follow, science-backed tip for keeping your eyes healthy while working at a computer. It's simple: every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds.

**Why should I use this app?**
202020 is a 100% free, open-source program that makes the 20/20/20 rule even more convenient. You can adjust timers, notifications, and more from the settings page. Plus, with keyboard shortcuts, you don't even need to open the 202020 window!

**Why can't I see the 202020 icon when it's running?**
If you have "Run in Taskbar" unchecked in settings (unchecked by default), 202020 runs in the tray.

**How do I download this app?**
202020 is exclusive to Windows PCs and can only be downloaded from the Microsoft Store.
